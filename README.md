# OAuth2 Proxy with Ingress

This project shows how to use [OAuth2 Proxy](https://oauth2-proxy.github.io/oauth2-proxy/), [GitHub OAuth Apps](https://github.com/settings/developers) and [NGINX Ingress Controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/) to route traffic.

## Overview

Many application do not provide built-in authentication or access control out-of-the-box.
Due to the sensitive data these applications process, this can be a major problem and it is often necessary to provide some type of security.

[OAuth2 Proxy](https://oauth2-proxy.github.io/oauth2-proxy/) is a reverse proxy that sits in front of your application and handles the complexities of OpenID Connect/OAuth 2.0 for you.

OAuth2 Proxy provides authentication using providers (GitHub, Google, and others) to validate accounts by email, domain or group.

## Prerequisites

Follow the next instructions to configure and run the project on your local machine:

- Install, at least, [Helm](https://helm.sh/), [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
- Install required charts with `helm dependency update` command.
- Register a new *GitHub App* to allow the access to *GitHub OAuth Apps*.
- Replace the following variables in the [values.yaml](values.yaml) file:
  - `OAUTH2_PROXY_CLIENT_ID`
  - `OAUTH2_PROXY_CLIENT_SECRET`
  - `OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_SECRET`
  - `OAUTH2_PROXY_DOMAIN`

## GitHub OAuth Apps

Before you begin, youâ€™ll need a free GitHub developer account.
Go to <https://github.com/settings/developers> and register a new OAuth application.

## Deploying

You can deploy to your cluster using `helm install [chart-name] [chart-folder-name]` command.
Replacing the missing values, the command is:

```bash
helm install oauth2-demo .
```

If you want to uninstall use `helm uninstall oauth2-demo` command.
